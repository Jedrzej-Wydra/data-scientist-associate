## Short summary
Built a complete house price prediction workflow including data cleaning, feature preprocessing, and baseline modeling with linear regression, then improved performance using XGBoost for gradient-boosted predictions.

## Technical summary
Implemented a reproducible data pipeline handling missing values with statistical imputations, feature encoding for categorical variables, and outlier management. Developed and validated two predictive models: a baseline linear regression and a gradient boosting model (XGBoost) with matrix-based feature transformation. Evaluated models on a validation set with RMSE-based metrics, comparing predictive stability across models. Leveraged R (dplyr, xgboost) for data wrangling, model fitting, and result visualization.

## History
This was probably one of the simplest projects I’ve taken on, but it felt necessary. A small data science exam, not meant to be a challenge, but rather a quiet confirmation that I had truly absorbed the basics. It wasn’t about proving anything to anyone else; just a personal checkpoint to see how far I’d come. Sometimes, even the easiest steps matter the most.
